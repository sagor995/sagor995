A Game Developer with an M.Sc. in Games and Extended Reality from the University of Salford, focusing on Unity, AI, and VR development. I began my career building mobile games and apps using Android Studio (Java) and MySQL, and later expanded into web development with PHP, MySQL, Django, and Laravel.

Currently, I specialize in creating immersive experiences in Unity, integrating AI systems, and developing VR projects. Until two months ago, I worked as a Technical Demonstrator at the University of Salford, where I provided hands-on support to students and staff in game design and VR/AR technologies. My role involved assisting with practical projects, managing VR equipment and gaming systems, and supporting lecturers to deliver smooth, engaging sessions.

I have recently started a new role as a Graduate CAVE Intern at Wigan and Leigh College, contributing to the development of immersive and interactive learning environments using cutting-edge virtual reality technologies.

Iâ€™m now seeking a full-time opportunity in game development or immersive technology where I can combine my technical skills and creativity to build innovative and impactful experiences.

Skills: C# / Python / Android Studio / Unity & Unreal / VR
